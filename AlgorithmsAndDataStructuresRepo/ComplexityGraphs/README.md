# ComplexityGraphs

This WPF application visualizes time and space complexity graphs for various algorithms.

## Features

- Displays graphs for different time complexities (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(2^n), O(n!))
- Displays graphs for different space complexities (O(1), O(n), O(n²))

## Requirements

- .NET Framework or .NET Core
- OxyPlot NuGet package

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application to view the graphs.
