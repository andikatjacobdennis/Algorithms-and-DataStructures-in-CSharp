### 4.3.1 Graph Representation

Graphs are fundamental data structures used to model relationships between objects. They consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). In C#, several methods can be used to represent graphs, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. The primary methods include the adjacency matrix, adjacency list, edge list, and incidence matrix.

#### 4.3.1.1 Adjacency Matrix

An adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array used to represent a graph. In this matrix, the rows and columns correspond to the graph's vertices, and the value at the intersection of a row and a column indicates whether an edge exists between the corresponding vertices.

**Example Implementation:**

```csharp
public class GraphAdjacencyMatrix
{
    private int[,] matrix;
    private int vertices;

    public GraphAdjacencyMatrix(int size)
    {
        vertices = size;
        matrix = new int[size, size];
    }

    public void AddEdge(int source, int destination)
    {
        matrix[source, destination] = 1; // Assuming a directed graph
        matrix[destination, source] = 1; // Uncomment for undirected graph
    }

    public void DisplayMatrix()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < vertices; j++)
            {
                Console.Write(matrix[i, j] + " ");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4.3.1.2 Adjacency List

An adjacency list is an array of lists. The index of the array represents a vertex, and each element in the list at that index represents the vertices connected by an edge. This representation is more space-efficient than an adjacency matrix, especially for sparse graphs.

**Example Implementation:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class GraphAdjacencyList
{
    private List<int>[] adjacencyList;

    public GraphAdjacencyList(int vertices)
    {
        adjacencyList = new List<int>[vertices];
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++)
        {
            adjacencyList[i] = new List<int>();
        }
    }

    public void AddEdge(int source, int destination)
    {
        adjacencyList[source].Add(destination); // For directed graph
        adjacencyList[destination].Add(source); // Uncomment for undirected graph
    }

    public void DisplayList()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < adjacencyList.Length; i++)
        {
            Console.Write(i + ": ");
            foreach (var vertex in adjacencyList[i])
            {
                Console.Write(vertex + " ");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4.3.1.3 Edge List

An edge list is a simple representation that consists of a list of edges, where each edge is a pair of vertices. This representation is particularly useful for algorithms that process edges, such as Kruskal’s algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree.

**Example Implementation:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class GraphEdgeList
{
    private List<Tuple<int, int>> edges;

    public GraphEdgeList()
    {
        edges = new List<Tuple<int, int>>();
    }

    public void AddEdge(int source, int destination)
    {
        edges.Add(Tuple.Create(source, destination)); // For directed graph
        // edges.Add(Tuple.Create(destination, source)); // Uncomment for undirected graph
    }

    public void DisplayEdges()
    {
        foreach (var edge in edges)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Edge: {edge.Item1} - {edge.Item2}");
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4.3.1.4 Incidence Matrix

An incidence matrix is a two-dimensional array where rows represent vertices and columns represent edges. The value at the intersection indicates whether a vertex is incident to an edge. This representation is less commonly used but can be beneficial in specific applications.

**Example Implementation:**

```csharp
public class GraphIncidenceMatrix
{
    private int[,] incidenceMatrix;
    private int vertices;
    private int edgesCount;

    public GraphIncidenceMatrix(int vertices, int edges)
    {
        this.vertices = vertices;
        edgesCount = edges;
        incidenceMatrix = new int[vertices, edges];
    }

    public void AddEdge(int edgeIndex, int source, int destination)
    {
        incidenceMatrix[source, edgeIndex] = 1; // Start vertex
        incidenceMatrix[destination, edgeIndex] = 1; // End vertex
    }

    public void DisplayMatrix()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < edgesCount; j++)
            {
                Console.Write(incidenceMatrix[i, j] + " ");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
```
